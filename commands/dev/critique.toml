1. Review the diff between this branch and `main` using `git diff main...HEAD -- ':!docs/*'`.
2. Critique the diff. Consider any areas where you are violating DRY, YAGNI, clear naming and comments for complicated or non-obvious bits code, and other best practices.
3. Identify the current project directory, finding the folder in ./docs with the highest prefix (./docs/NN_FEATURE/)
4. Add the list of issues you identified to ./docs/NN_FEATURE/tickets.md, prioritized by high/medium/low.

For each of the issues you identified:
1. Implement the proposed changed.
2. Ensure all verification steps pass.
3. You MUST ALWAYS ensure the checks in `./docs/CHECKS.md` all pass. Re-run all checks if you make any changes to address an issue.
4. Update tickets.md to mark the ticket as complete.
5. Commit your changes with a clear explanation of your work.
