1. Review and critique the diff between this branch and `main`. Consider any areas where you are violating DRY, YAGNI, clear naming and comments for complicated or non-obvious bits code, and other best practices.
2. Share the list of issues you've found, prioritized by high/medium/low.
3. Address all of the high/medium-priority issues you identified, and any low-priority issues with simple fixes.
4. Ensure the checks in `./docs/CHECKS.md` all pass. Re-run all checks if you make any changes to address an issue.
