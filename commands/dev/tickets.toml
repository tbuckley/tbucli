description = "Generate tickets for a feature"
prompt = """
Create tickets for the current feature by following these steps:
1. Identify the current project directory, finding the folder in ./docs with the highest prefix (./docs/NN_FEATURE/)
2. Review the notes.md and prd.md files in that folder
3. Create a tickets.md file breaking the work into ordered steps.
5. Await my approval before proceeding further.

Each step must:
- be a self-contained milestone that can be committed.
- include verification steps (ex. unit tests, e2e tests, scripts to run, files to read, etc; just no manual steps). These should usually include the checks in `./docs/CHECKS.md`.
- include a status, which defaults to "not started"
