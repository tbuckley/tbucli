Identify the current project directory, finding the folder in ./docs with the highest prefix (./docs/NN_FEATURE/).

Continue implementing the tickets in tickets.md one by one. Check what you have done so far (git diff), and then for each ticket:
1. Implement the proposed changed.
2. Ensure all verification steps pass.
3. You MUST ALWAYS ensure the checks in `./docs/CHECKS.md` all pass. Re-run all checks if you make any changes to address an issue.
3. Update tickets.md to mark the ticket as complete.
4. Commit your changes with a clear explanation of your work.

You MUST frequently update ./docs/NN_FEATURE/development_log.md throughout your work. Track any useful information, steps taken, gotchas, etc.
