prompt = """
Identify the current project directory, finding the folder in ./docs with the highest prefix (./docs/NN_FEATURE/). Continue implementing the tickets in tickets.md one by one. Check what you have done so far (git diff), and then for each ticket:
1. Implement the proposed changed.
2. Ensure all verification steps pass. You MUST ALWAYS ensure `npm run {lint,check,test}` all pass; and re-run them all if you make any edits to resolve an issue.
3. Update tickets.md to mark the ticket as complete.
4. Commit your changes with a clear explanation of your work.
You MUST frequently update ./docs/NN_FEATURE/development_log.md throughout your work. Track any useful information, steps taken, gotchas, etc.
