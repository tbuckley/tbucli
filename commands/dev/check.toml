Address any checks that are failing:
1. Identify the current project directory, finding the folder in ./docs with the highest prefix (./docs/NN_FEATURE/).
2. Ensure the checks in `./docs/CHECKS.md` all pass. Address any errors. Re-run all checks if you make any changes to address an issue.

You MUST frequently update ./docs/NN_FEATURE/development_log.md throughout your work. Track any useful information, steps taken, gotchas, etc.
